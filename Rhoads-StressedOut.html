    <h1>Stressed Out by Twenty One Pilots</h1>
    <hr>
<pre>
<p>I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard<br>
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words<br>
I wish I found some <a href="https://www.guitartricks.com/chords"<cite>chords</cite></a> in an order that is new<br>
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang<br>
I was told when I get older, all my fears would shrink<br>
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think<br>
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think<br>
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think</p>
<p><strong>Wish we could turn back time<br>
To the good old days<br>
When our mama sang us to sleep<br>
But now we're stressed out (oh)<br>
Wish we could turn back time (oh)<br>
To the good old days (oh)<br>
When our mama sang us to sleep<br>
But now we're stressed out<br>
We're stressed out</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young<br>
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from?<br>
I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it<br>
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one<br>
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose<br>
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam<br>
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered<br>
Out of student loans and <a href="https://treetopbuilders.net/"<cite>tree house homes</cite></a>, we all would take the latter<br>
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think<br>

But now we're stressed out</strong></p>
<p>Used to play pretend, give each other different names<br>
We would build a rocket ship, and then we'd fly it far away<br>
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughing at our face<br>
Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money, " yeah<br>

We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money<br>
